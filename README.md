⚠️ PROJECT INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE⚠️
The Countdown Game is a web-based recreation of the classic British TV quiz show Countdown, designed for both desktop and mobile browsers. The game challenges players by generating a set of random numbers along with a target number. The player must use their arithmetic problem-solving skills to reach the target, using the given numbers and any results from calculation made. Numbers can only be used once unless the user undoes their previous equation making the number available to use again. It’s a time-based, single-player experience that combines fun with cognitive skill-building.

The project aims to deliver a sleek, responsive interface with an engaging user experience, complete with a real-time countdown timer, score tracking, and validation of answers. The game is ideal for casual play and educational purposes alike.

The rationale behind this project is to develop a browser-based game that encourages mental agility, problem-solving, and quick thinking — skills that are often underrepresented in typical casual games. Inspired by the enduring popularity of the Countdown show, this web app provides an accessible version of the game without requiring installation or login.

From a development perspective, this project serves as a practical application of web development fundamentals, including DOM manipulation, a timer, responsive design, and user input validation. It also presents features like device orientation handling — bettering the user experience.

#### 5. Surface

**Visual Design Elements**
- **[Colours](#colour-scheme)** (see below)
- **[Typography](#typography)** (see below)

### Colour Scheme

The color palette was designed to balance energy, clarity, and playfulness, supporting both usability and visual excitement for the player:

Main Theme Color – #4d05f6 (Deep Purple/Blue)
This is used consistently for text, borders, and highlights. Purple is bold and energetic, while still being easy on the eyes. It provides strong contrast against the lighter background and gives the game a modern, tech-inspired aesthetic.

Sub Theme Color – #ffef08 (Bright Yellow)
This acts as the primary accent color. Yellow conveys urgency and draws attention, making it ideal for interactive elements like buttons, titles, and the console "PLAY?" prompt. It reinforces the game’s competitive and time-based nature by injecting vibrancy.

Feature Color – deeppink
Pink is used sparingly for standout features and strike-through markers. This introduces variety and visual hierarchy, helping the player notice when numbers have been used. It also adds a playful, fun edge to balance the intensity of the purple and yellow.

Calm Color – #ffffff (White)
White provides a neutral balance to the bold theme and is used for backgrounds, ensuring that text and game elements remain legible. It keeps the interface clean and prevents the brighter colors from overwhelming the user.

Background Gradient
The page background is styled with a linear gradient that flows from soft pastel pinks (#feddfc) into deep blues (#1717f6), vivid magentas (#f40590), and bright sky tones (#67dcf0). This gradient was chosen to create a sense of depth and progression, evoking the feeling of moving through different "levels" of the game. It also makes the environment more immersive and engaging, giving the interface a playful, almost arcade-like atmosphere while still keeping readability intact.

Overall, the palette combines high contrast for readability, bright accents for engagement, and a gradient backdrop to establish a playful yet immersive mood. This ensures the game feels both exciting and approachable while keeping the focus on solving the puzzle.



I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/4d05f6-ff1493-ffffff-ffef08) to generate my color palette.

- `#4d05f6`  --main-theme-color.
- `#ffef08`  --sub-theme-color.
- `deeppink`  --feature-color.
- `#ffffff` --calm-color.

![screenshot](documentation/images/coolors-colour-theme.png)

### Typography

The typography was selected to reflect both the futuristic arcade feel of the game and the clarity needed for puzzle-solving. The fonts have been imported from Google Fonts and have been used in the following way:

Main Font – Orbitron (Sans-serif)
Orbitron is a geometric, futuristic typeface that immediately evokes the feeling of technology and digital displays. It’s used across the main interface to give the game a bold, modern identity while also being highly legible.

Sub Font – Scope One (Serif)
Scope One provides contrast as a softer, more traditional serif font. It’s used in secondary headings and text to balance Orbitron’s sharp edges with a touch of readability and elegance. This contrast helps establish hierarchy in the design.

Working Grid Font – Libre Franklin (Sans-serif)
Libre Franklin is applied to the working-out grid and keypad. It’s a clean, highly legible sans-serif that makes input fields and number interactions easy to read during gameplay. Its neutrality ensures the focus stays on solving equations, while still harmonizing with the more stylistic fonts.

Together, these fonts combine futuristic energy (Orbitron), clarity for calculations (Libre Franklin), and balance through traditional contrast (Scope One). This mix reinforces the game’s identity as both playful and puzzle-driven.

Instead of sticking to a single font, I intentionally combined three typefaces to give the game a unique personality while still prioritizing readability.
This mix avoids monotony, keeps the design visually interesting, and makes sure that both the thematic elements and functional aspects of the game are well supported.

## Features

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each feature. You should explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on your target audience, what they want to achieve, and how your project can help them achieve these things.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

### Existing Features

| Feature | Notes | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operators | The mathematical operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) are large and colorful to allow users to easily select their preferred method of testing their calculation skills. Each operator is color-coded, and has the text name as well for easy identification. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/operators.png) |
| Equation | This section visibly displays the current equation to be calculated, dynamically updated to use the specific operator that the user has selected above. The empty `<input>` field allows users to enter valid numerical values to test their math skills. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/equation.png) |
| Submit Answer | This button allows user to submit their calculation to see if they've successfully answered the current equation. Users can also use the `[ENTER]` key on their keyboard to submit their answers, too. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/submit-answer.png) |
| Scores | This section tallies the total number of *correct* and *incorrect* answers that the user has calculated. Green to represent *correct*, and red to represent *incorrect*. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/scores.png) |
| Alerts | Depending on whether or not the user gets the calculation correct or incorrect, alerts are used to provide simple feedback to the user. This showcases if they got it correct, or if they've gotten it incorrect, therefore also showing the correct answer. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/alerts.png) |
| 404 | The 404 error page will indicate when a user has somehow navigated to a page that doesn't exist. This replaces the default GitHub Pages 404 page, and ties-in with the look and feel of the *Love Maths* site by using the standard navbar and footer. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/404.png) |

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

⚠️ TIP ⚠️

Consider adding screenshots of your Projects Board(s), Issues (open and closed), and Milestone tasks.

⚠️ --- END ---⚠️

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/Louiseskinner01/project2-the-countdown/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/Louiseskinner01/project2-the-countdown/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

| Link | Screenshot |

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCoW" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The site was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/Louiseskinner01/project2-the-countdown), navigate to the "Settings" tab.
- In Settings, click on the "Pages" link from the menu on the left.
- From the "Build and deployment" section, click the drop-down called "Branch", and select the **main** branch, then click "Save".
- The page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed message display to indicate the successful deployment.
- Allow up to 5 minutes for the site to fully deploy.

The live link can be found on [GitHub Pages](https://louiseskinner01.github.io/project2-the-countdown).

### EmailJS API

This application uses [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs) to handle sending emails from the live site.

Instructions on how to connect EmailJS to this project:

- [Sign Up](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/sign-up) for an EmailJS account on their website.
- Create an **Email Service** from your EmailJS dashboard.
- In your EmailJS dashboard, navigate to the **API Keys** section, and copy your *API Key*.
- Add the following code snippet into the `head` of your HTML file at the top.
    - Make sure you have added your own `API Key`.

```js
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@4/dist/email.min.js"></script>
<script>
   (function(){
      emailjs.init({
        publicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
      });
   })();
</script>
```

- Create an "Email Template" in your EmailJS dashboard. This template will define the content and structure of the emails you'll send.
- Write JavaScript functionality to send emails using EmailJS. Below is very basic syntax for the code example, but check the EmailJS docs for further code:

```js
emailjs.send(serviceID, templateID, templateParams, options);
```

- Call your function whenever you want to send an email.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

There are no remaining major differences between the local version when compared to the deployed version online.

## Credits

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

In the following sections, you need to reference where you got your content, media, and any extra help. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials (which is totally acceptable), however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid potential plagiarism.

⚠️ --- END ---⚠️

### Content

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to provide attribution links for any borrowed code snippets, elements, and resources. Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every resource used, not just a generic link to the main site. If you've used multiple components from the same source (such as Bootstrap), then you only need to list it once, but if it's multiple Codepen samples, then you should list each example individually. If you've used AI for some assistance (such as ChatGPT or Perplexity), be sure to mention that as well. A few examples have been provided below to give you some ideas.

Eventually you'll want to learn how to use Git branches. Here's a helpful tutorial called [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org) to bookmark for later.
